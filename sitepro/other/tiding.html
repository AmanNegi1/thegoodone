					lots and lots of people who desperately need this kind of information people who are responsible for keeping viruses off of computers have now been able to get it.While individual users who have limited contact with other computer users may be able to successfully protect themselves with an off the shelf anti virus,experience seems to be proving that such is not the case when one starts looking at the network with 10,000 users on it.
                    The scientifically correct term for a computer virus is self reproducing automaton, or 'SRA' for short. This term describes correctly what such a program does,rather than attaching emotional energy to it <br> 
                    For starters,very few anti-virus systems will run on 10,000 computers with a wide variety of configurations, etc. Secondly, when someone on the network encounters a virus,they have to be able to talk to someone in the organization who has the detailed technical knowledge necessary to get rid of it in a rational way. You can't just shut such a big network down for 4 days while someone from your av vendor's tech support staff is flown in to clean up, or to catch and analyze a new virus.<br>
                    The computer virus overcomes the roadblock of operator control by hiding itself in other programs.Thus it gains access to the CPU simply because people run programs that it happens to have attached itself to without their knowledge. The ability to attach itself to other programs is what makes the virus a viable electronic life form. That is what puts it in a class by itself. The fact that a computer virus attaches itself to other programs earned it the name "virus." However that analogy is wrong since the programs it attaches to are not in any sense alive.

                    <h2 style="background-color:#07B7FA;border-radius:5px;">Trojen Horse</h2>
                    
                    <p>In computing, a Trojan horse, or Trojan,is any malicious computer program which misleads users of its true intent.Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems.Once activated,Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you,steal your sensitive data,and gain backdoor access to your system
                    <br>People who have attacked computers and their data have invented several different kinds of programs.since one must obviously conceal the destructive nature of a program to dupe somebody into executing it,deceptive tricks are an absolute must in this game. The first and oldest trick is the "trojan horse."The trojan horse may appear to be a useful program,but it is in fact destructive.It entices you to execute it because it promises to be a worthwhile program for your computer new and better ways to make your machine more effective-but when you execute the program,surprise! Secondly,destructive code can be hidden as a "logic bomb" inside of an otherwise useful program.You use the program on a regular basis,and it works well. Yet, when a certain event occurs, such as a certain date on the system clock, the logic bomb "explodes" and does damage. These programs are designed specifically to destroy computer data, and are usually deployed by their author or a willing associate on the computer system that will be the object of the attack. There is always a risk to the perpetrator of such destruction. He must somehow deploy destructive code on the target machine without getting caught. If that means he has to put the program on the machine himself,or give it to an unsuspecting user,he is at risk. The risk may be quite small,especially if the perpetrator normally has access to files on the system, but his risk is never zero</p>
                    
                    <h2 style="background-color:#07B7FA;border-radius:5px;">Type of virues</h2>
                    
                    <p>Computer viruses can be classified into several different types. The first and most common type is the virus which infects any application program.On IBM PC's and clones running under PC DOS or MS DOS, most programs and data which do not belong to the operating system itself are stored as files. Each file has a file name eight characters long, and an extent which is three characters long. A typical file might be called "TRUE.TXT", where "TRUE" is the name and "TXT" is the extent.The extent normally gives some information about the nature of a file in this case "TRUE.TXT" might be a text file. Programs must always have an extent of "COM", "EXE", or “SYS”. Under DOS, only files with these extents can be executed by the central processing unit. If the user tries to execute any other type of file, DOS will generate an error and reject the attempt to execute the file.<br>
                    Since a virus's goal is to get executed by the computer,it must attach itself to a COM, EXE or SYS file.If it attaches to any other file, it may corrupt some data, but it won't normally get executed, and it won't reproduce. Since each of these types of executable files has a different structure,a virus must be designed to attach itself to a particular type of file.A virus designed to attack COM files cannot attack EXE files,and vice versa, and neither can attack SYS files. Of course, one could design a virus that would attack two or even three kinds of files, but it would require a separate reproduction method for each file type. The next major type of virus seeks to attach itself to a specific file, rather than attacking any file of a given type. Thus, we might call it an application-specific virus. These viruses make use of a detailed knowledge of the files they attack to hide better than would be possible if they were able to infiltrate just any file.For example,they might hide in a data area inside the program rather than lengthening the file. However, in order to do that, the virus must know where the data area is located in the program, and that differs from program to program.<br>
                    This second type of virus usually concentrates on the files associated to DOS, like COMMAND.COM, since they are on virtually every PC in existence. Regardless of which file such a virus attacks, though, it must be very, very common, or the virus will never be able to find another copy of that file to reproduce in, and so it will not go anywhere. Only with a file like COMMAND.COM would it be possible to begin leaping from machine to machine and travel around the world. The final type of virus is known as a "boot sector virus."This virus is a further refinement of the application-specific virus,which attacks a specific location on a computer's disk drive,known as the boot sector.The boot sector is the first thing a computer loads into memory from disk and executes when it is turned on.By attacking this area of the disk, the virus can gain control of the computer immediately, every time it is turned on, before any other program can execute.In this way,the virus can execute before any other program or person can detect its existence

                   <h3 style="background-color:#07B7FA;border-radius:5px;">function of the viruses</h3>
                   <p>
                   	Every viable computer virus must have at least two basic parts,or subroutines,if it is even to be called a virus. Firstly,it must contain a search routine, which locates new files or new areas on disk which are worthwhile targets for infection. This routine will determine how well the virus reproduces, e.g., whether it does so quickly or slowly, whether it can infect multiple disks or a single disk, and whether it can infect every portion of a disk or just certain specific areas. As with all programs, there is a size versus functionality tradeoff here. The more sophisticated the search routine is, the more space it will take up. So although an efficient search routine may help a virus to spread faster, it will make the virus bigger, and that is not always so good. Secondly, every computer virus must contain a routine to copy itself into the area which the search routine locates. The copy routine will only be sophisticated enough to do its job without getting caught. The smaller it is, the better. How small it can be will depend on how complex a virus it must copy. For example, a virus which infects only COM files can get by with a much smaller copy routine than a virus which infects EXE files.This is because the EXE file structure is much more complex, so the virus simply needs to do more to attach itself to an EXE file.<br>
                   	While the virus only needs to be able to locate  suitable hosts and attach itself to them, it is usually helpful to incorporate some additional features into the virus to avoid detection, either by the computer user, or by commercial virus detection software. Anti-detection routines can either be a part of the search or copy routines,or functionally separate from them. For example,the search routine may be severely limited in scope to avoid detection.A routine which checked every file on every disk drive, without limit, would take a long time and cause enough unusual disk activity that an alert user might become suspicious. Alternatively, an antidetection routine might cause the virus to activate under certain special conditions. For example, it might activate only after a certain date has passed (so the virus could lie dormant for a time).<br>
                   	Alternatively, it might activate only if a key has not been pressed for five minutes (suggesting that the user was not there watching his computer). Search, copy,and anti-detection routines are the only necessary components of a computer virus, and they are the components which we will concentrate on in this volume. Of course, many computer viruses have other routines added in on top of the basic three to stop normal computer operation,to cause destruction, or to play practical jokes.Such routines may give the virus character,but they are not essential to its existence.In fact,such routines are usually very detrimental to the virus's goal of survival and self-reproduction, because they make the fact of the virus' existence known to everybody.If there is just a little more disk activity than expected, no one will probably notice, and the virus will go on its merry way. On the other hand,if the screen to one's favorite program comes up saying "Ha! Gotcha!" and then the whole
                    VIRUS
					Anti-detection routines
					Search Copy computer locks up, with everything on it ruined, most anyone can figure out that they've been the victim of a destructive program. And if they're smart, they'll get expert help to eradicate it right away.The result is that the viruses on that particular system are killed off,either by themselves or by the clean up crew. Although it may be the case that anything which is not essential to a virus's survival may prove detrimental,many computer viruses are written primarily to be smart delivery systems of these "other routines."The author is unconcerned about whether the virus gets killed in action when its logic bomb goes off, so long as the bomb gets deployed effectively.The virus then becomes just like a Kamikaze pilot, who gives his life to accomplish the mission. Some of these "other routines" have proven to be quite creative.For example, one well known virus turns a computer into a simulation of a wash machine, complete with graphics and sound. Another makes Friday the 13th truly a bad day by coming to life only on that day and destroying data. None the less, these kinds of routines are more properly the subject of volume three of this series, which discusses the military applications of computer viruses. In this volume we will stick with the basics of designing the reproductive system. And if you're real interest is in military applications, just remember that the best logic bomb in the world is useless if you can't deploy it correctly.The delivery system is very,very important.the situation is similar to having an atomic bomb,but not the means to send it half way around the world in fifteen minutes. Sure,you can deploy it,but crossing borders,getting close to the target,and hiding the bomb all pose considerable risks.The effort to develop a rocket is worthwhile.

                   <h2 style="background-color:#07B7FA;border-radius:5px;">how viruses are created</h2>
                   <p>
                   	Viruses are written in assembly language.High level languages like Basic ,C, and Pascal have been designed to generate stand alone programs,but the assumptions made by these languages render them almost useless when writing viruses.They are simply incapable of performing the acrobatics required for a virus to jump from one host program to another. That is not to say that one could not design a high level language that would do the job, but no one has done so yet.Thus,to create viruses,we must use assembly language.It is just the only way we can get exacting control over all the computer system's resources and use them the way we want to, rather than the way somebody else thinks we should.<br>If you have not done any programming in assembler before,I would suggest you get a good tutorial on the subject to use along side of this book.( A few are mentioned in the Suggested Reading at the end of the book.) In the following chapters,I will assume that your knowledge of the technical details of PC's-like file structures,function calls, segmentation and hardware design-is limited,and I will try to explain such matters carefully at the start. However,I will assume that you have some knowledge of assembly language-at least at the level where you can understand what some of the basic machine instructions, like mov ax,bx do. If you are not familiar with simpler assembly language programming like this, get a tutorial book on the subject. With a little work it will bring you up to speed.
