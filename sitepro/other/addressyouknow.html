  <h1>Blockchain</h1>
  <p>To understand the blockchain completly first we should know the basic terms used in Blockchain.</p>
  <p style="font-family:Times New Roman; font-weight: bold;font-size: 1.4em;"><h3>what is bitcoin : </h3> Bitcoin is a form of digital currency,created and held electronically.No one controls it.Bitcoins aren’t printed,like dollars or euros–they’re produced by people,and increasingly businesses, running computers all around the world, using software that solves mathematical problems.Bitcoin is the first kind of the money which can be proceeded in physically or electrically.It has a lot of benefits over the another money system.<br><br><center><mark>1 bitcoin = 1052689.02 Indian Rupee<br><br>1 bitcoin = 16619.53 US Dollar <br><br> 1 bitcoin = 13814.81 Euro </mark></center></p>

  <p><center> <img class="img-responsive" src="blockchain.jpg" alt="blockchain" width="700px"  height="400px" align="middle" "></center></p>
  <p ><br>In Bitcoin their is no need of the third party (like bank and other services) operation while transction,all transction happen peer to peer. Bitcoin can be used to buy things electronically.In that sense,it’s like conventional dollars,euros,or yen, which are also traded digitally.  As above mention that Bitcoin does not have 3rd party while transction so that our all infomation gets private to us.<br><br>A software developer called <mark>Satoshi Nakamoto</mark> proposed bitcoin, which was an electronic payment system based on mathematical proof. The idea was to produce a currency independent of any central authority, transferable electronically, more or less instantly, with very low transaction fees.

  <p><h4 style="color:black;"><br>Who prints it : </h4><br>
  No one. This currency isn’t physically printed in the shadows by a central bank, unaccountable to the population, and making its own rules. Those banks can simply produce more money to cover the national debt, thus devaluing their currency.

  Instead, bitcoin is created digitally, by a community of people that anyone can join. Bitcoins are ‘mined’, using computing power in a distributed network. This network also processes transactions made with the virtual currency, effectively making bitcoin its own payment network.<br><br>
  So you can’t churn out unlimited bitcoins?
  <br>
  That’s right. The Bitcoin protocol – the rules that make bitcoin work – say that only 21 million bitcoins can ever be created by miners. However, these coins can be divided into smaller parts (the smallest divisible amount is one hundred millionth of a bitcoin and is called a ‘Satoshi’, after the founder of bitcoin).</p>
